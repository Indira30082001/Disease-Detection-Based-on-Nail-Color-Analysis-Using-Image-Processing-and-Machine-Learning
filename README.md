**Disease detection based on Nail Color Analysis using Image processing and Machine Learning**
**Abstract**
Medical research has led to numerous advancements in diagnostic
procedures, yet traditional pathological testing remains time-consuming,
invasive, and challenging. To address these limitations, this study proposes a
novel approach that utilizes **nail color analysis for early disease detection.**
Dermatological studies have shown that changes in nail color are strong
indicators of various health conditions. Our system leverages computer
vision and machine learning, particularly **Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNN),** to analyze nail images with greater precision than the human eye. By
processing digital images, extracting features, and segmenting nail
characteristics, the system detects subtle color variations linked to potential
health abnormalities. Unlike conventional diagnostic methods, this approach
requires no heavy equipment, making it a more accessible and efficient
solution. The developed web tool allows medical professionals to analyze nail
images and identify potential diseases in their early stages, improving timely
diagnosis and intervention.
